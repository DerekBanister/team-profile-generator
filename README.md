# Team Profile Generator

**My Team Profile Generator is a command line application that takes in user inputs and creates an html page based on those inputs. The inputs in this application revolve around assembling your programming team. You have 3 role selections, which include Manager, Engineer, and Intern. Each role has specific traits with Manager's having office numbers, Engineer's have Github links with their repositories linked, and Intern's have their school listed. Along with that specific info, Name's, roles, e-mail's, and ID's are also supported inputs.**
